# Hi! {#hi}

I'm [Ayrat](https://www.badykov.com/), and you've stumbled upon my braindump.
This website contains my working notes accumulated over some years. I haven't exported
all notes yet. So stay tuned

You can start hopping around by going to the [full index](/notes/) or [check out my open source projects](/notes/20210830181701-my_projects/).

Have fun!
