[EVM](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/) is a virtual machine used in Ethereum based blockchains.

High-level smart contract languages (Solidity) are compiled to the EVM bytecode.

Formal spec can be found in the [Ethereum Yellow Paper]({{<relref "20210831150523-ethereum_yellow_paper.md#" >}}).
