[My Braindump](https://braindump.badykov.com/about/) is generated with [ox-hugo](https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo) from my [Org-Roam]({{<relref "20210831213556-org_roam.md#" >}}) notes. The current idea for it is to be my personal knowledge system.

Backlog:

-   Simplify the process of exporting notes

-   Maintain two sets of notes.

    Public notes will be used in the braindump. Private notes will be used for personal thoughts, projects and ideas

-   Add additional info to notes (created at, updated at, etc)

-   Take a look at the issue when there are too many stacked pages

Thoughts:

-   Should I dump (:]) by braindump weekly ?
