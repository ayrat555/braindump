[BN](https://github.com/mana-ethereum/bn) - BN128 elliptic curve operations for Elixir.

The implementation is inspired (copied :]) from [the Vitalik Buterin's python implementation](https://github.com/ethereum/py%5Fecc).

It was needed for the [Ethereum Virual Machine]({{<relref "20210831154424-ethereum_virual_machine.md#" >}}) operation codes in [Mana]({{<relref "20210830184907-mana.md#" >}})
