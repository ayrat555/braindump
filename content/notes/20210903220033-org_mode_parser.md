[Org Mode]({{<relref "20210831195358-org_mode.md#" >}}) is one of the best things in Emacs.

But there are a lot of situations when I want to export org mode files into a different format.

For example, I want to create a custom exporter of my [Org-Roam]({{<relref "20210831213556-org_roam.md#" >}}) notes into [My braindump]({{<relref "20210831225847-my_braindump.md#" >}}).

There are a couple of projects but they're not complete:

-   [orgize](https://github.com/PoiScript/orgize)
-   [org-rs](https://github.com/org-rs/org-rs)
