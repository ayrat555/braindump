[My blog](https://www.badykov.com/) is hosted on [github pages](https://github.com/ayrat555/ayrat555.github.io) and it uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). I started writing posts for it in the October of 2017.

Now I write at least a single post per month.

Backlog:

-   Change theme / maybe migrate to a different static site generator

-   Add search

    This feature is mostly needed for myself

Thoughts:

-   Should I migrate all my posts to my [My braindump]({{<relref "20210831225847-my_braindump.md#" >}})?
