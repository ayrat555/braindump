[El Monitorro](https://github.com/ayrat555/el%5Fmonitorro) is a telegram bot for reading  RSS, Atom and JSON feeds. It's written in Rust.


## Key features: {#key-features}

-   High performance.

    All processing is done with [Fang]({{<relref "20210830182841-fang.md#" >}})

-   Filters - users can provide key words he wants to subscribe to

-   Templates - users can set a format of messages

    Currently, it's implemented using handlebars. And UX can be improved

A couple of channels created with this bot:

-   <https://t.me/emacs%5Fposts> - Emacs News and Posts
-   <https://t.me/metacritic%5Ftv> - Latest Tv Show Metascores on Metacritic

The libraries I wrote for this project:

-   [Fang]({{<relref "20210830182841-fang.md#" >}})
-   [Frankenstein]({{<relref "20210830183352-frankenstein.md#" >}})


## Backlog {#backlog}

-   Update readme and release a new version of the bot on dockerhub
-   Update env variables


## Potential features / improvements {#potential-features-improvements}

-   Limit the number of superfast feeds

-   Exponential backoff for failed feeds

-   Do not upsert feeds items on every sync
    (compare the last fetched item and item in the db)

-   Instead of syncing every feed periodically sync the earliest feeds.

-   Use handlebars directly for templates

    UX for templates can be improved
-   Add good looking landing site

-   Allow users to set their bot token
