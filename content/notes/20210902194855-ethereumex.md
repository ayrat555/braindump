[Ethereumex](https://github.com/mana-ethereum/ethereumex) - Elixir JSON-RPC client for the Ethereum blockchain

Key features:

-   Supports IPC and HTTP

-   Batch requests

-   Custom RPC calls

-   Complete wrapper for Ethereum API

It was my first Ethereum related library. I wrote the first version over one weekend.
