[org-roam](https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam) is a plain-text knowledge management system. It uses [org-mode]({{<relref "20210831195358-org_mode.md#" >}}) files. Initiallly, org-roam was developed as a [Roam research]({{<relref "20210831213924-roam_research.md#" >}}) clone.

I use org-roam almost for all my notes and [my braindump]({{<relref "20210831225847-my_braindump.md#" >}}) is generated from my org-roam notes

Some thoughts about note-taking :

-   It seems you have to make the effort to take notes. Otherwise your notes are useless
