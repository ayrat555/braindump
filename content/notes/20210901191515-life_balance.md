I released a mobile game called "Life Balance" in 2019.

The idea of the game is an infinite runner with multiple life bars.

I released it both for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thoughtkraken.lifebalance) and iOS. But it was taken down from the App Store because I stopped my dev subscription.

In 2021 I ported the game to web:

-   [itch.io](https://ayrat555.itch.io/life-balance)
-   [self-hosted](https://thoughtkraken.com/life%5Fbalance/play)

The game also has a [landing site](https://thoughtkraken.com/life%5Fbalance).

I think the game failed financially because I didn't promote it. Now there are multiple games with similar gameplay. But at the time there were none.

The song used in the web version of the game is from [Zephyr Deer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbfVobWjNXo).

Backlog:

-   Stop paying for **thoughtkran.com** host name use **badykov.com**

-   Migrate landing to Github Pages or Nerlify
