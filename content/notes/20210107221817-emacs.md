Emacs is an (esoteric) text editor. Its key feature is extensibility. Emacs provides Emacs Lisp programming language which is used to write extensions.

Emacs community created some of the best packages that can not be found in other text editors:

-   Magit - the most usable git interface.
-   [Org Mode]({{<relref "20210831195358-org_mode.md#" >}}) is a document editing, formatting, and organizing mode

You can check out [my blog post](https://www.badykov.com/emacs/2018/07/31/why-emacs-is-a-great-editor/) I wrote a long time ago where I'm trying to sell Emacs.

My emacs config can be found in [the github repo](https://github.com/ayrat555/dot-emacs)

The only problem I'm having with Emacs is it's draining my free time :)
