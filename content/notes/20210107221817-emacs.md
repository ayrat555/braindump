Emacs is an (esoteric) text editor. Its key feature is extensibility. Emacs provides Emacs Lisp programming language which is used to write extensions.

Great Emacs packages:

-   [Magit](https://magit.vc/) - a git interface
-   [Org-Mode]({{<relref "20210831195358-org_mode.md#" >}}) is a document editing, formatting, and organizing mode
-   [Org-Roam]({{<relref "20210831213556-org_roam.md#" >}}) is a personal knowledge management tool

You can check out [my blog post](https://www.badykov.com/emacs/2018/07/31/why-emacs-is-a-great-editor/) I wrote a long time ago where I'm trying to sell Emacs.

My emacs config can be found in [the github repo](https://github.com/ayrat555/dot-emacs)

The only problem I have with Emacs is it drains my free time :)
