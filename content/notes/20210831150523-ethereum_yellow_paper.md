[Ethereum Yellow Paper](/ethereum-yellow-paper.pdf) is a formal specification of Ethereum protocol.

This document is the main source of truth for implementing Ethereum nodes (clients).

It's written very formal so it's better to start from [the Ethereum Whitepaper](https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/)
