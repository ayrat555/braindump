[company-elixir](https://github.com/ayrat555/company-elixir) is a [company-mode](https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode) completion backend for Elixir.

It uses a separate IEx (Elixir's interactive shell) process to fetch completions from.

I abandoned this project but it can be used as a reference for [async company backends](https://www.badykov.com/emacs/2020/05/05/async-company-mode-backend/).
