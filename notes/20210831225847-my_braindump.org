[[https://braindump.badykov.com/about/][My Braindump]] is generated with [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo][ox-hugo]] from my [[id:695E8B9A-73D7-4D3F-89F2-5D11D1BA2A61][Org-Roam]] notes. The current idea for it is to be my personal knowledge system.

* Related links:

- [[https://github.com/ayrat555/braindump][github repo]] - my braindump is hosted on github with github pages
- [[https://github.com/ayrat555/cortex-dark][cortex-dark]] - hugo theme for the braindump

* Backlog:

- Simplify the process of exporting notes

- Maintain two sets of notes.

  Public notes will be used in the braindump. Private notes will be used for personal thoughts, projects and ideas

- Add additional info to notes (created at, updated at, etc)

- Take a look at the issue when there are too many stacked pages

- Add analytics

- Add a list of my posts

- Add README to the Repo

* Thoughts:

- Should I dump (:]) by braindump weekly ?
