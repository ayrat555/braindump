Emacs and Org-Mode are great things. But you may lose days and months configuring them and looking for best practices (org-mode).

But I have a feeling it may pay off eventually:

- In case of Emacs, you'll save time if you learn your keybindings
- In case of org-mode, you'll be more organized and productive

At least it's my excuse to dive into them every time. But I saw a couple of posts where people say they don't have time for Emacs as they become older.
