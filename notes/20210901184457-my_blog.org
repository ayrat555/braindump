[[https://www.badykov.com/][My blog]] is hosted on [[https://github.com/ayrat555/ayrat555.github.io][github pages]] and it uses [[https://jekyllrb.com/][Jekyll]]. I started writing posts for it in the October of 2017.

Now I write at least a single post per month.

Backlog:

- Change theme / maybe migrate to a different static site generator

- Add search

  This feature is mostly needed for myself

Thoughts:

- Should I migrate all my posts to my [[id:DA3661CB-35B7-4CB2-B4C9-63505168E5B7][My braindump]]?
