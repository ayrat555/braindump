[[https://github.com/mana-ethereum/mana][Mana]] - Ethereum node implementation in Elixir.

It was started as a hobby project. But after it got some attention from the community (POA Network) I've started working on it full time.

I've worked on it with a good team of developers for almost a year. Now it's abandoned but it can be used as a reference.
