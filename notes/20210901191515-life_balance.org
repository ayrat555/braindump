#+title: Life Balance
#+filetags: :projects:games:

I released a mobile game called "Life Balance" in 2019.

The idea of the game is an infinite runner with multiple life bars.

I released it both for [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thoughtkraken.lifebalance][Android]] and iOS. But it was taken down from the App Store because I stopped my dev subscription.

In 2021 I ported the game to web:

- [[https://ayrat555.itch.io/life-balance][itch.io]]
- [[https://thoughtkraken.com/life_balance/play][self-hosted]]

The game also has a [[https://thoughtkraken.com/life_balance][landing site]].

I think the game failed financially because I didn't promote it. Now there are multiple games with similar gameplay. But at the time there were none.

The song used in the web version of the game is from [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbfVobWjNXo][Zephyr Deer]].

Backlog:

- Stop paying for *thoughtkran.com* host name use *badykov.com*

- Migrate landing to Github Pages or Nerlify
