[[https://github.com/ayrat555/company-elixir][company-elixir]] is a [[https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode][company-mode]] completion backend for Elixir.

It uses a separate IEx (Elixir's interactive shell) process to fetch completions from.

I abandoned this project but it can be used as a reference for [[https://www.badykov.com/emacs/2020/05/05/async-company-mode-backend/][async company backends]].
