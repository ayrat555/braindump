#+title: Changing displayed style of org links
#+filetags: :emacs:orgmode:

     #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (org-link-set-parameters "id"
                           :face 'org-roam-header-line)
     #+END_SRC

In the code snippet above replace *id* with a type of link that you want to change (for example, *http*), instead of *'org-roam-header-line* you can set any face.

You can see all available links with *M-x list-faces-display*

*  The Problem

I spent a couple of hours trying to solve this problem with *font-lock-add-keywords* function.

The initial problem I was solving is setting a custom style for my org roam links. Because they're not distinguishable from other types of links.
