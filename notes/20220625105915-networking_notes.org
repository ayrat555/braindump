* OSI Model

** 7 layers that standartize networks

** Not used anymore - tcp / ip is sued

** Layers

  - Physical - cable
  - Data link - mac address
  - Network - ip address, routing
  - Transport - TCP / UDP
  - Session - start / stop sessions
  - Presentation - format data, encryption
  - Application - SMTP (email)

* TCP/IP model

 Created to standartize computer networking

** Application - application protocols (http, smtp, ftp)  - DATA

** Transport - TCP/UDP protocols   - SEGMENT

** Network  - IP                  - PACKET

** Data link - ETHERNET           - FRAME

** Physical - Cable

* TCP vs UDP

** TCP

*** Used when good and reliable connection is needed (for example to download files)

*** Two computers ack the connection before it takes place. Three way handshake

   - Syn -> Syn Ack -> Ack Received

*** Tcp assigns numbers to data that being sent

*** Receiver calculates checksum and sends to sender

*** Tcp will re-send data if it wasn't delivered

** UDP

*** It doesn't establish a session

*** Fire and forget protocol

*** Udp is faster

*** Live realtime connections - voice call, video calls, gaming

* Mac Address

**  Unique address assigned to network interface card

* DNS - domain name system

** DNS translates domain name into ip address

- Check local cache first
- If it's not found in local cache - dns resolver
- If it's not found in dns resolver - root server
- Top level domain server

* HTTP / HTTPS

** HTTP - data transferred not encrypted

** HTTPS - data transferred encrypted

*** a client tries to access an https site

*** a site returns certificate with public key

*** a client verifies certificate in the certificate authority

*** a client create a new secret key and signs it with the public key in the certificate

*** all communication is encrypted with this private key
