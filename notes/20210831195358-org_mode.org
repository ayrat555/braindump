[[https://orgmode.org/][Org Mode]] is one of the most powerful note taking and planning tools. It uses plain text files in a special markup format.

The only disappointment for me is its logo

* Thoughts

  - It seems there are no complete parsers for org-mode files ( [[id:040ABB8A-9634-427F-B41F-FD238D8EE010][Org mode parser in Rust]] ).

    It would be nice to have it. For example, I want to create a custom generator of hugo files for [[id:DA3661CB-35B7-4CB2-B4C9-63505168E5B7][my braindump]]. Because ox-hugo is not very performant
