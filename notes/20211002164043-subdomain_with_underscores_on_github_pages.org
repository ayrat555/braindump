#+title: Subdomain with underscores on github pages
#+filetags: :braindump:

I wasn't able to enable https for my project site - https://github.com/ayrat555/el_monitorro (el_monitorro.badykov.com/)

it was returning the following error:

/Certificate Request Error: Certificate provisioning will retry automatically in a short period, please be patient./

It turns out GitHub can't generate an ssl ceriticate for subdomains with underscores.

When I changed the subdomain to *elmonitorro*, the ssl certificate was finally generated
