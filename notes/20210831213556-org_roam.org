[[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam][org-roam]] is a plain-text knowledge management system. It uses [[id:BA8CAFC9-6132-4761-BAFB-EF05C5C3306A][org-mode]] files. Initiallly, org-roam was developed as a [[id:931C6E34-F627-41DC-879E-F30AB53D5276][Roam research]] clone.

I use org-roam almost for all my notes and [[id:DA3661CB-35B7-4CB2-B4C9-63505168E5B7][my braindump]] is generated from my org-roam notes

Some thoughts about note-taking :

- It seems you have to make the effort to take notes. Otherwise your notes are useless
