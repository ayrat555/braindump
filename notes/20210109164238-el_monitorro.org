[[https://github.com/ayrat555/el_monitorro][El Monitorro]] is a telegram bot for reading  RSS, Atom and JSON feeds. It's written in Rust.

* Key features:

- High performance.

  All processing is done with [[id:02FBC785-4C3F-4C0C-A7CB-19A70ABCA0F7][Fang]]

- Filters - users can provide key words he wants to subscribe to

- Templates - users can set a format of messages

  Currently, it's implemented using handlebars. And UX can be improved
