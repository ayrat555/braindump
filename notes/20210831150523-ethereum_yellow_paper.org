#+title: Ethereum Yellow Paper
#+filetags: :ethereum:

[[file:docs/ethereum-yellow-paper.pdf][Ethereum Yellow Paper]] is a formal specification of Ethereum protocol.

This document is the main source of truth for implementing Ethereum nodes (clients).

It's written very formal so it's better to start from [[https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/][the Ethereum Whitepaper]]
