[[https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Deterministic_wallet#Type_2:_Hierarchical_deterministic_wallet][Hierarchical deterministic wallet]] is a wallet that may generate a new key pair from a master key pair for each crypto transaction to enhance privacy and security.

There is already [[https://github.com/KamilLelonek/ex_wallet][an implementation for bitcoin]]. But it seems not maintained. Also it doesn't support related chains like Dogecoin.
